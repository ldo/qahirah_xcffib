This module wraps the [xcffib Python binding](https://github.com/tych0/xcffib)
for XCB as an extension to Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah)), my Python binding for the
Cairo graphics library. You will need to have that installed as well.

This module subclasses `qahirah.XCBSurface` with overriding create
methods that take `Connection` and other objects as defined by xcffib
and does appropriate conversions before passing them to the
corresponding methods in the base class.
