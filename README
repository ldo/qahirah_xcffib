This module wraps the [xcffib Python binding](https://github.com/tych0/xcffib)
for XCB as an extension to Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah)), my Python binding for the
Cairo graphics library. You will need to have that installed as well.

This module subclasses `qahirah.XCBSurface` with overriding create
methods that take `Connection` and other objects as defined by xcffib
and does appropriate conversions before passing them to the
corresponding methods in the base class. This allows you to use
Cairo to do onscreen drawing via Qahirah. It also interfaces to the
standard `asyncio` event loop API introduced in Python 3.5, providing
useful functions for handling events and creating cursors, among other
things.
